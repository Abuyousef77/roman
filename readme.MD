# Epicodus Track Suggester

This is a functional roman numeral translator, as it is now, it works for integers between 0 and 3,999. It will be improved to include numbers up to the limit of Roman Numerals, 3.99 Million.

## Getting Started

This project will either be available for download immediately, or will be available on Github pages.

After downloading, drag and drop "index.html" onto an empty Google Chrome tab.

### Prerequisites

If you can view this, then there is a incredibly likely chance that you already have all the prerequisites.

If you can not view this, or are on a mobile browser, I would suggest you accommodate the nearest desktop or laptop computer with an internet connection. For more advanced users, transfer the downloaded file to that computer.
